# Binary-Segmentation-For-Wildfire-Detection
We have carried out binary semantic segmentation to detect wildfire and smoke. We used 4 bakbone architectures- Mobile Vision Transformer- Small and Extra Small Variant , Mobilenetv3 -Large variant and ResNet50. These backbone architectures were integrated with Deeplabv3+ segmentation framework. Codes have been implemented using tensorflow.
